## What is Penumbra?

Penumbra is a crate for interacting and servicing with MediaTek devices over [DA](../da/download_agent.mdx) mode. It provides a high-level API for interacting with the device, which can be used to implement custom tools for many operations, such as firmware flashing, readback, bootloader unlocking, RPMB operations, and more.

Penumbra is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPLv3-or-later), and as such, any code that incorporates, links or is directly derived from Penumbra must also be licensed under the AGPLv3 or later.

Penumbra is not intended to be used for malicious purposes, rather as a tool for servicing and repairing devices. Please use it responsibly. As such, no support will be provided for FRP erasing, IMEI spoofing.

## Requirements

To use Penumbra on your own code, you'll need to add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
penumbra-mtk = { git = "https: //github.com/shomykohai/penumbra", branch = "main" }
```

:::info
You'll need to use the `nightly` rust toolchain to build Penumbra, as it uses some unstable features.

## Usage

Below, is a simple example of how to use Penumbra to connect to a device and perform some operations:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{BufWriter, Write};

use anyhow::Result;
use penumbra::{DeviceBuilder, find_mtk_port, LockFlag};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    env_logger::init();

    let da_path = std::path::Path::new("../DA_fogorow.bin");
    let da_data = std::fs::read(da_path).expect("Failed to read DA file");

    // Specify the VID and PID to filter only Preloader port
    let vid = Some(0x0E8D);
    let pid = Some(0x2000);

    // Find the MTK port with the specified VID and PID.
    // Backend set to Auto will try to find the first compatible port,
    // with either USB or Serial.
    let mtk_port = PortType::find_device(vid, pid, PortBackend::Auto)
        .expect("Port should open")
        .ok_or("No MTK port found")?;

    println!("Found MTK port: {}", mtk_port.get_port_name());

    let mut device = DeviceBuilder::new(mtk_port)
        .with_da_data(da_data)
        .build()?;

    // Init the device (Handshake and populate dev info)
    device.init()?;

    let tgt_cfg = device.devinfo().target_config();
    println!("SBC: {}", (tgt_cfg & 0x1) != 0);

    // This will automatically enter DA mode. 
    // Seccfg unlock only works if the device can load extensions / is vulnerable
    device.set_seccfg_lock_state(LockFlag::Unlock)?;

    let mut progress = |read: u64, total: u64| {
        println!("Progress: {}/{}", read, total);
    };

    let file = File::create("lk_a.bin")?;
    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(file);

    device.read_partition("lk_a", &mut progress, &mut writer)?;

    writer.flush()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Feature flags

Penumbra has some feature flags you can enable.

* `nusb` - Enabled the `nusb` backend for USB. This is the default one.
* `libusb` - Enabled the `libusb` backend for USB. This is an alternative to `nusb`, and may work better on some platforms.
* `serial` - Enabled the `serial` backend for Serial. Works best on windows with default MediaTek VCOM drivers, but not all features might be available.
* `localslakeyring` - Use penumbra sla keyring for completing SLA challenges. This includes leaked keys for some devices.
* `reenumerate` - Reenumerate the device to DA mode after the handshake. This will slow down connection during initialization, but may be useful for some devices.
* `exploits` - Enable exploits, automatic DA patching, [[DA Extensions]] and custom commands. This allows to perform more operations on vulnerable devices, and read/write to partitions that are normally locked and memory regions.

By default, penumbra enables `nusb`, `libusb`, `serial`, `localslakeyring` and `exploits`. You can disable them by using `default-features = false` in your `Cargo.toml`:
